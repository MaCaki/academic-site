  <p>I am currently a pursuing an M.A. in mathematics. My interests are in discrete geometry and combinatorial optimization. 
		At the moment I am looking at polytopes related to matroids and in particular, 
		the permutohedron and generalized permutohedra, 
		which you can read more about <a href="?page=permutohedra"> here </a>. </p>
